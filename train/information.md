# YOLOv8 Fine-Tuning Setup and Tasks

This document outlines the setup and tasks required to fine-tune the YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset.

## Overview

- **YOLOv8 Model**: The YOLOv8 model is the latest in the YOLO series and is considered the best option for our use case.

- **Project Structure**:
  - `setup.py`: This script splits the data into training and validation sets in the format required by YOLOv8.
  - `train.py`: This script handles the fine-tuning of the YOLO model using the data generated by `setup.py`.
  - `yolov8.pt`: The pre-trained YOLOv8 model file that will be fine-tuned.

- **Configuration File**: There's a configuration file located at `/Users/francouys/Library/Application Support/Ultralytics/settings.yaml` (this path may vary). This file tells YOLO where to look for data, so make sure to update it if needed.

## Known Issues and Tasks

### Issues

- **FIXME**: The prediction of YOLO after fine-tuning is not displaying bounding boxes.
- **FIXME**: Make all code OS-agnostic (e.g., replace `"sample/path"` with `os.path.join("...")`).

### Tasks

- **TODO**: Get the YOLO fine-tuning working on our images (start with one epoch).
- **TODO**: Ensure the fine-tuning works and train the model for a larger number of epochs.
- **TODO**: Use YOLO to predict bounding boxes for all training images.
- **TODO**: Crop the detected bounding boxes and manually transform the features.
- **TODO**: Extract features from the cropped images using a CNN.
- **TODO**: Perform regression (e.g., XGBoost) on the extracted features.
